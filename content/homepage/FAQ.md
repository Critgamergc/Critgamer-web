#### Do I have to register online to attend “THE LAN”?

Walk-ins are welcome. But those that don’t pre-register online will end up completing the exact same process at the event during the first step of on-site registration. This is to keep the numbers of registrants consistent.

#### What is the BYOC?

The Bring Your Own Computer (BYOC) area at “The LAN”. We provide the tables, chairs, power, and enormous gaming network; you bring your computer that’s ready-to-play your favorite video games. It’s just about that simple. Servers and open network shares will be provided for sharing games. **You CAN also bring your own chair to the event.**

#### What should I bring?

You should bring your computer (1 tower/desktop or laptop), 1 monitor, and any peripherals within reason that you want to use at the event like a keyboard, mouse, and **HEADPHONES ONLY (NO SPEAKERS)**. Please bring an enclosed computer in a case, nothing external. This is an open environment where space is precious.

#### What size monitor/computer can I bring?

We’re relatively flexible. The tables in “The LAN” are six foot folding tables (2 persons per table), and each attendee seat is half of a table (three feet). You should plan to fit everything you bring with you well-enough inside of that space that you’re a good neighbor to your fellow attendees. Please Contact Us! if you think you need a special consideration. Please don’t plan on bringing anything to place in an aisle. It’s important to the safety of other attendees that our footpaths remain clear should there be an emergency.
