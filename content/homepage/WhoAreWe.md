Critgamer was originally started in 2009 as a YouTube Channel with an online blog for content creation and sharing. During the preliminary phases of the brand we realized there was demand for a consistent LAN Gaming Community in our local area

In 2014 we started marketing as a LAN Gaming Community. Our primary focus is on creating a competitive exciting gaming environment for the East Texas Community. We have since built an organization that will continue to build on the traditions of LAN BYOC and community gaming. These events are hosted quarterly at local venues with help from our generous sponsors.

Our goal is to expand this brand and the culture of LAN Gaming across Texas and beyondâ€¦
